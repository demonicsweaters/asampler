# a simple bash script for creating Amiga formatted samples on a Raspberry Pi running Amibian or UAE4Arm
#
#   this script was designed to work with Amibian for capturing audio samples into a simple usb microphone input for the raspberry pi.
#   It will first check your audio level then ask you three questions, what is the length of the recording in seconds?, 
#   what would you like to name the sample? And what sample rate?
#
#   Before you run it the first time make sure you put the path to your sample directory at the bottom of the script.
#   you must have the program sox intalled before this will work.
